### Zig Standard Library

The [Zig Standard Library](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/std/) has its own documentation.

Zig's Standard Library contains commonly used algorithms, data structures, and definitions to help you build programs or libraries.
You will see many examples of Zig's Standard Library used in this documentation. To learn more about the Zig Standard Library,

Alternatively, the Zig Standard Library documentation is provided with each Zig distribution. It can be rendered via a local webserver with:

**Shell:**

```shell
